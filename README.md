# Unexpected Empty Result Set from SQL Query

This repository demonstrates a common issue in SQL queries where an empty result set is returned when data is expected. This can occur when the WHERE clause filters out all potential records.

The `bug.sql` file shows a query that may return an empty set unexpectedly. The `bugSolution.sql` file illustrates how to handle this situation using different approaches like checking for the existence of data before executing the main query or using UNION ALL to include data indicating the absence of results.

This example highlights the importance of careful query design and error handling when working with SQL databases.
